        <p>I have been taking software developing courses from online educational resources (Treehouse, then Udemy) for a year prioritizing web development.</p>
        <p>After a year of studying I got a Fullstack Web-developer position at the small web studio Spacety in Smolensk. Here I gained my first experience working with business project. At first I was only writing simple landing pages without animation. Later I was working on landing pages with a lot of dynamic data and animated transitions and also on games on HTML Canvas. I was used Vue.js for dynamic landing pages and Pixi.js for for the games..</p>
        <p>After 11 months working at Spacety I was on the highest development position at Spacety and I could do much more than I was offered. So I found a job at Middle JavaScript Developer position in CSSSR, a Moscow web studio where all of the employees work remotely, but still closely communicate to each other. I coded for React/Redux project, wrote a simple Express backend, leaded a small team through two projects (one on Angular and other on React) and helped several colleagues to learn Angular and RxJS.</p>
        <p>I really love learning: I'm currently diving into functional programming with Elm and Haskell, taking Polish and French lessons and teaching myself music theory.</p>
