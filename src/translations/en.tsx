        <p>I have been taking software developing courses from online educational resources (Treehouse, then Udemy) for a year prioritizing web development.</p>
        <p>After that I was able to get Fullstack Web-developer position offer at the small web studio Spacety in Smolensk, where I had a great experience of working with large variety of developing tools, libraries and frameworks to accomplish different tasks from creating landing pages to HTML Canvas-based games. I also had much experience woking with DOM animations there. We used Vue.js, React and Angular depending on the task on frontend. For a backend we used Laravel for almost all of the cases.</p>
        <p>After 11 months working at Spacety I reached the peak of the career one is able to get there as a developer. So I found a job at Middle JavaScript Developer position in CSSSR, a Moscow web studio where all of the employees work remotely, but still closely communicate to each other. My tasks here included working with React ecosystem, Angular 2+ and Node.js.</p>
        <p>I really love learning: I'm currently diving into Android development and React Native, taking piano lessons and a French course.</p>
